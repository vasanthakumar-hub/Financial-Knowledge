        Gold: Gold is valuable due to its rarity, durability, and historical significance as a medium of exchange and store of value. It tends to hold its value during economic turbulence, and investors appreciate its potential for a safe haven. It is also used in jewelry and electronics, so there are some real-world uses of gold.

        Real Estate: Real estate investment is the practice of purchasing property as an investment rather than as a primary residence, in order to generate income. It may be simply defined as any piece of land, structure, infrastructure, or other tangible assets that are often immobile yet transferrable to get a profit from it.19 Apr 2024
